Hi, I’m Terence Colaco. After recovering from covid-19 in March of 2021, I decided to chart an entirely new career path and emerged from this difficult time in my life determined to fearlessly enhance my skills and those of others as much as possible. After extensive research I decided to apply for a new job opportunity while pursuing some type of cyber security skills bridging program through a local college or university.

As a result, I am currently enjoying the cybersecurity bootcamp program through the University of Toronto. I will complete the program in December of 2021 and and can't wait to begin my cybersecurity career. In my present role I am working towards becoming a certified IMIS software admin to obtain some more practical day to day workplace experiences with IT administration.

I’m fascinated by the prospects of becoming either a Cloud Network Architect, SOC analyst or SIEM analyst. As a Cloud Network Architect overseeing an organization's cloud computing strategy would connect strongly with my creative, investigative and enterprising nature. Conversely, working as SOC/SIEM analyst to identify security weaknesses and opportunities for potential improvements would appeal to the curious, proactive and competitive aspects of personality.

I’m currently gaining experience with a host of popular tools such as Wireshark, Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nessus, and more. The U of T SCS Cybersecurity Boot Camp has been challenging and very rewarding. I've enjoyed this multidisciplinary approach in attaining proficiency in IT, networking, and modern information security, throughout the course. I am earning skills applicable to certifications such as the CompTIA Security+, Network+, Linux+, Server+, Cloud+ and certified Ethical Hacker (CEH).

Upon graduation I intend to initially pursue my CompTIA Security+ certification to further cement my skills learned during the boot camp.

I’m looking to network with prospective and current IT industry professionals to learn and share experiences and knowledge. Any conversation would be appreciated as I continue to humbly and passionately enjoy my journey.
